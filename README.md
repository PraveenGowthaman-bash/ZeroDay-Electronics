## 🕶️ About This Repository

**ZeroDay-Electronics** is my personal vault of experimental projects where **Embedded Systems**, **IoT**, and **Cybersecurity** collide.  
It's not about making perfect things. It's about learning how things break, how things work, and how things can be made better.

## 🧑‍💻 What's Inside?

### 🔌 Regulated Power Supply (0-24V DC)
> Build your own power — literally. Circuit designs, simulations, and test results.

### 🚦 DC Motor Control with Ultrasonic Sensor
> Automation starts here. Basic Arduino project to detect obstacles and react.

### 🚀 Future Projects: Secure IoT Devices
> Combining microcontrollers with cybersecurity concepts.  
Think: encryption, authentication, and tamper detection at the hardware level.

## 🛡️ Philosophy

- **Understand** the fundamentals.
- **Build** what others overlook.
- **Break** what shouldn't break.
- **Secure** what matters.
